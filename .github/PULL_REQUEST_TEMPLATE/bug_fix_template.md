### Requirements for Contributing a Bug Fix

- Fill out the template below.
- The pull request should update the test suite, if you know how.
- After you create the pull request, all status checks must be pass before a maintainer reviews your
  contribution.

### Identify the Bug

<!--
Link to the issue describing the bug that you're fixing. If there is not yet an issue for your bug,
please open a new issue and then link to that issue in your pull request. Note: In some cases, one
person's "bug" is another person's "feature." If the pull request does not address an existing
issue with the "bug" label, the maintainers have the final say on whether the current behavior is a
bug.
-->

### Description of the Change

<!--
We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description.
If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here,
the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.

### Possible Drawbacks

### Verification Process

What process did you follow to verify that your change has the desired effects?
- How did you verify that all new functionality works as expected?
