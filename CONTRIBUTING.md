# How to contribute

Thanks for reading (and hopefully understanding) this.

## There are some basic rules for contributing

- Read the code of conduct (not fully but read the main points).
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org) for commits and pull request/issue
  titels as well.
- Have a basic understaing what a monorepo is.

There's nothing else you should know.

## Happy coding âœ¨
